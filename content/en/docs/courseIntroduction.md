**Earn up to 6 Limited Edition Hackathon Digital Badges!**

![Hackathon Badges](http://modernapps.ninja/june2021hackathon_hw3657/admin/assets/images/Hackathon%20Badges.png)

Hackathon week provides an opportunity to contribute to community, network with peers, learn and gain experience by opening and resolving issue tickets, make github commits with content updates, or even help with new site features!

You do not need to be a developer, you can be a beginner with github, each step to participate has clear and simple instructions. 

6 new limited edition Digital Badges will be available to participants who complete the simple requirements for each badge. In addition to earning the badges, each of the contributions you make will be reflected on your public github profile!

Anyone who opens an issue ticket, validates or updates content, contributes new content or features will be able to earn badges!

While many hackathons focus on building sample coding ideas that may or may not ever be used, in the ModernApps Learning hackathon you will contribute directly to production assets, and the hackathon badges will state clearly that you contributed to production assets!

### Prerequisites  

You must be a member of the ModernApps Ninja community to earn badges. Membership is completely free - to register, it is recommended that you complete the [ModernApps Skills 101 course](https://modernapps.ninja/course/modernappsskills101_ms4043/), which which will walk you through membership registration and also how to (1) open an issue ticket and use a simple, browser based process to (2) post new files and (3) modify existing files on a public GitHub repository. These 3 skills are the 3 most important core skills you need to start actively participating and contributing to any git/github project!

Also note per the details in the sections below, if you complete the [ModernApps Skills 101 course](https://modernapps.ninja/course/modernappsskills101_ms4043/) and submit an issue/feedback ticket during the hackathon week period, you will earn the Hackathon QA Contributor badge.

## Instructions

**Note:** You must have a free ModernApps Learning membership to be able to request a badge. If you are not a member, please sign up for a membership by following the instructions on the [https://modernapps.ninja](https://modernapps.ninja) homepage.

To request your digital badge, you will need to post a "evidence file" with a link to the URL that shows the work you completed to earn the badge. This is a very simple process that is almost identical to the process you use when you enroll in any ModernApps Learning course. There is a unique folder where you will post your evidence file for each badge - the link for each badge is provided in the respective section for each badge below. 

Once you open the pull request to post your evidence file, an administrator will review your request, and once your request is approved an automated GitHub action workflow will trigger that will provision your digital badge and update your member page with a record, the entityID and the verification link to your digital badge on [https://badgr.com](https://badgr.com).

Once your badge is provisioned, you will be notified with a message that will be posted by the workflow to the ModernAppsNinja Members Team message board [on this thread](https://github.com/orgs/ModernAppsNinja/teams/members/discussions/9). The award message will at-mention your GitHub account which will ensure you will recieve a notification in your GitHub Notifications panel.

After you have recieved the message verifying your award has been provisioned, you will be able to verify your award details on your member profile page at the URL https://modernappsninjas.github.io/**YourGitHubUsername**/certs/ being sure to insert your github username as indicated in the URL. The digital badge is provisioned to the email address you used to register with the ModernApps Learning community, which you can verify at https://github.com/modernappsninjas/**YourGitHubUsername**/blob/main/static/userdata/member_record.yml. You can also create an account or login to an existing account with the email address you used to register with the ModernApps Learning community, and when you login to the associated badgr account, you should see all of the badges you have earned from ModernApps Learning programs.

ModernApps learning only provides a description and link to your blog - your content may be hosted on any publically available website and should be free and not require any charge or payment to access.
