&lt;h2 id="hackathon-week-overview">Hackathon Week Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hackathon week provides an opportunity to contribute to community, network with peers and learn and gain experience by opening and resolving issue tickets, make github commits with content updates, or even help with new site features!.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You do not need to be a developer, you can be a beginner with github, each step to participate has clear and simple instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>6 new limited edition Digital Badges will be available to participants who complete the simple requirements for each badge. In addition to earning the badges, each of the contributions you make will be reflected on your public github profile!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone who opens an issue ticket, validates or updates content, contributes new content or features will be able to earn badges!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While many hackathons focus on building sample coding ideas that may or may not ever be used, in the ModernApps Learning hackathon you will contribute directly to production assets, and the hackathon badges will state clearly that you contributed to production assets!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You must be a member of the ModernApps Ninja community to earn badges. Membership is completely free - to register, it is recommended that you complete the &lt;a href="https://modernapps.ninja/course/modernappsskills101_ms4043/">ModernApps Skills 101 course&lt;/a>, which which will walk you through membership registration and also how to (1) open an issue ticket and use a simple, browser based process to (2) post new files and (3) modify existing files on a public GitHub repository. These 3 skills are the 3 most important core skills you need to start actively participating and contributing to any git/github project!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also note per the details in the sections below, if you complete the &lt;a href="https://modernapps.ninja/course/modernappsskills101_ms4043/">ModernApps Skills 101 course&lt;/a> and submit an issue/feedback ticket during the hackathon week period, you will earn the Hackathon QA Contributor badge&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="instructions">Instructions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In future hackathons we intend to focus contribution efforts towards validating new courses, refreshing specific courses, or working towards specific features; However in the June 2021 hackathon, all valid bug reports, feature requests, feedback tickets, contributions to any course, guide or site page will be eligible towards completing digital badge requirements per the instructions in the following subsections.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>After you have completed these requirements, please keep the url to the digital badge you earned for completing the course, and the issue ticket number and URL for the ticket you used to submit your course feedback, as you will need these items to request your Hackathon digital badge.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It does not matter in which forum you provided this support, as long as you helped to provide an answer or other support to resolve another member&amp;rsquo;s question/issue. You may typically find users seeking support in the issue tickets on any repo in the ModernAppsNinja org, in the Members team discussion board, or on the #modernappsninja slack channel in the VMware Code slack domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To request this badge, please keep the ticket number/url or a screenshot or other record of the conversation where you helped resolve another members question.&lt;/p>
